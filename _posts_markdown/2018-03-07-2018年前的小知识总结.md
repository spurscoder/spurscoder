- Chatbot

  A Chatbot is a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. **Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition.**

- Dialog system
